# Hack The Bay
## Production-ready AI Agents Hackathon @ AI By the Bay 11/18 - 11/19 2025

Join us for a 2-day hackathon dedicated to building production-ready AI Agents that can accomplish something amazing in a business-to-business or business-to-consumer use case.


## THE CHALLENGE

You will need to make sure your agent is maintainable, scalable, and observable and also secure by design, i.e., safe from agent-related attack vectors (prompt injection, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, broken access controls, etc). 

You will need to illustrate how your agent accomplishes these production-ready tasks while still providing access to business data and processes. Bonus points if you use tools to validate the production readiness of your agent.

## WHO SHOULD ATTEND

Developers looking to build their next production-ready AI agent project, alongside the best software engineers and legends within the Bay Area and beyond. 

Max team size is 5. No team? No problem. We’ll help match you with others at the event. At least 30% of the team should come in person. 

*All attendees must be registered and approved on Luma.* 

*In-person attendees will get complimentary expo passes to the AI By the Bay conference.*

*We’d be happy to help you make the case to your manager about the value of participating in our hackathon. Just email us at info@bythebay.io, and we’ll send you key points you can share.*
