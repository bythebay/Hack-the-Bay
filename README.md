# Hack The Bay
## Production-ready AI Agents Hackathon @ AI By the Bay 11/18 - 11/19 2025

Join us for a 2-day hackathon dedicated to building production-ready AI Agents that can accomplish something amazing in a business-to-business or business-to-consumer use case.


## THE CHALLENGE

You will need to make sure your agent is maintainable, scalable, and observable and also secure by design, i.e., safe from agent-related attack vectors (prompt injection, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, broken access controls, etc). 

You will need to illustrate how your agent accomplishes these production-ready tasks while still providing access to business data and processes. Bonus points if you use tools to validate the production readiness of your agent.

## WHO SHOULD ATTEND

Developers looking to build their next production-ready AI agent project, alongside the best software engineers and legends within the Bay Area and beyond. 

Max team size is 5. No team? No problem. We’ll help match you with others at the event. At least 30% of the team should come in person. 

*All attendees must be registered and approved on Luma.* 

*In-person attendees will get complimentary expo passes to the AI By the Bay conference.*

*We’d be happy to help you make the case to your manager about the value of participating in our hackathon. Just email us at info@bythebay.io, and we’ll send you key points you can share.*

- [Fred Patton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thoughtpoet/) is a Senior Developer Advocate at Auth0 for Okta. He helps teams design AI systems that are scalable, accountable, and identity-aware. Prior to Auth0, he led developer-facing work on streaming data platforms at Nstream (formerly Swim .ai) working in security and healthtech.
- [Prashanth Rao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prrao87/) is an AI engineer at LanceDB. He's spent a lot of time working on use cases related to RAG, knowledge graphs, vector search, and incorporating them as tools for agents using modern frameworks like DSPy and BAML. He writes about these techniques on his blog, [thedataquarry.com.](https://thedataquarry.com/)
- [Vaibhav Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaigup/) leads Boundary (YC w23), he hates ugly code. And as we know, most agent systems out there wouldn't pass a code review. So Viabhav is building BAML for clean, reliable AI infra. [[AI that works podcast] ](https://boundaryml.com/podcast)
- Gaurav Jain is a Senior Staff Engineer at Pure Storage, where he leads the customer-facing GenAI Copilot initiative. A Carnegie Mellon alumnus, he combines broad engineering perspective with deep expertise in large-scale systems, applied AI, and building production-ready, enterprise-grade agents.

He has a rich background in scaling engineering teams and products, notably at WePay and Coursera, where he organized large-scale AI hackathons. His current work at Donobu focuses on AI-driven quality assurance, making him a perfect fit for judging this hackathon focused on production-ready AI agents.
- [Francis Bouvier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisbouvier/) is CEO and co-founder of Lightpanda, the first web browser built for machines, not humans. His previous company BlueBoard, an e-commerce analytics platform, was acquired by ChannelAdvisor in 2020. Through this experience, Francis realised first hand the limitations of existing web automation solutions, inspiring him to launch Lightpanda.


Mentors are also familiar with MCP which you may want to use for data/process integration. 

Please keep in mind, the mentoring and technical support are available but limited. Your team should have all the skills to troubleshoot any technical issues otherwise.

## RUBRIC

Projects will be evaluated on production readiness, innovation, technical complexity, practicality, user experience, and overall quality. A detailed judging rubric can be found [here](https://github.com/bythebay/Hack-the-Bay/blob/main/rubric.md)
